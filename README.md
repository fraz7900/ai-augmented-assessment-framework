# AI-Augmented Compliance Assessment Platform

A local-first, privacy-preserving platform that accelerates energy-sector cybersecurity compliance assessments (C2M2, NIST CSF 2.0, extensible to NERC CIP / ISO 27001 / CIS Controls / SOC 2 / PCI DSS) using document ingestion, local LLM reasoning, evidence-to-control mapping, maturity scoring, and executive reporting.

This repository is developed as a structured, sprint-based engagement — every sprint produces a working increment plus consulting-style documentation (architecture decisions, business value assessment, risk register). See `PROJECT_CHARTER.md` for the full problem statement and scope.

## Status

**Sprint 4 complete: both MVP frameworks (C2M2, NIST CSF 2.0) now real and scored, verified against their actual official source documents.**
A real FastAPI app (`backend/src/compliance_platform`) ingests documents, embeds them locally (ONNX, no PyTorch, no network calls), tracks assessments through a draft → in-review → finalized lifecycle, and scores both C2M2 maturity (cumulative MIL0-3 per domain — 2 of 10 domains fully transcribed, 71 real practices) and NIST CSF 2.0 (coverage-based, 0.0-1.0 per function — **all 6 functions, 106 of 106 subcategories fully transcribed**) from real, source-cited framework data, through one scoring engine that dispatches per framework rather than branching on framework name. 91 automated tests pass. Run it yourself:

```
cd backend && source .venv/bin/activate && uvicorn compliance_platform.main:app --reload
```

then `POST` a file to `/ingest`, `POST /assessments` with `framework_name` set to `C2M2` or `NIST CSF 2.0`, `POST /assessments/{id}/evidence` with a real practice ID (`ACCESS-1a` for C2M2, `PR.AA-01` for NIST — see `GET /frameworks/{name}`), and `GET /assessments/{id}/score`. See `docs/consulting/sprint-04-deliverables.md` for what was built, and `docs/adr/ADR-0010-nist-csf-coverage-scoring.md` for why NIST CSF 2.0 is scored differently from C2M2 and why it has full rather than partial coverage.

## Data and privacy notice

All evidence documents and assessment data used in this repository during development are public framework documentation or synthetic sample artifacts. No real client or employer data is used at any point. See `data/sample_evidence/README.md`.

## Technology

Python (FastAPI, backend live as of Sprint 1), React (frontend, not yet started), LanceDB (vector storage, decided in ADR-0005), a local ONNX semantic embedding backend (fastembed / BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5, decided in ADR-0008, superseding the interim hashed-vector backend of ADR-0006), SQLite via SQLModel (assessment/evidence storage, decided in ADR-0007), Ollama (local LLM reasoning, planned for Sprint 3+), optional Claude/OpenAI API fallback (planned, explicitly opt-in only).

## Roadmap

Primary frameworks: C2M2, NIST CSF 2.0. Future extensibility: NERC CIP, ISO 27001, CIS Controls, SOC 2, PCI DSS. Full sprint sequence in `PROJECT_CHARTER.md` Section 13.
