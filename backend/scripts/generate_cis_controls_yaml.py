Unlike ISO 27001 (ADR-0024), CIS Controls v8 is genuinely freely
available: it is published by the Center for Internet Security under a
Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-No Derivatives 4.0
International license, which explicitly permits copying and
redistributing the content (non-commercially, with attribution) — a
materially different situation from ISO 27001's paid, all-rights-
reserved standard. Confirmed directly (not assumed) before writing any
code: fetched the official CIS Controls Navigator
(https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-navigator/v8),
rendered it with a headless browser (its Safeguard list is populated by
client-side JavaScript, not present in the raw HTML), and cross-checked
its 153-Safeguard/18-Control structure against the full CIS Controls
v8 PDF (May 2021, CC BY-NC-ND 4.0), which was used to source every
Safeguard's real, complete descriptive text below — not just a title,
unlike ISO 27001.

Every Practice.text below combines the real official Safeguard title
and its full descriptive text (mirroring how this project already
combines a table's label and body text elsewhere, e.g. NERC CIP's
Parts). Practice.applicability holds the real Implementation Group
(IG1/IG2/IG3) markers from the Safeguards table — a genuine reuse of
the applicability concept ADR-0021 introduced for NERC CIP's per-part
impact-tier scoping, since IG level scopes which Safeguards apply to
which size/risk profile of enterprise in the same structural way.
